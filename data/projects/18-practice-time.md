A tool to help musicians keep track of their practice and get an overview of how often/well
they practice. The app runs fully locally and leverages PWA (Progressive Web App) technics
to allow it to be installable, run fully offline and stores all data inside the browser (no
accounts required). And comes with a simple import/export feature to back up and migrate the
locally stored DB.
