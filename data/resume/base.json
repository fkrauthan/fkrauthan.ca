But in the case of Florian, I certainly mean it; it was a privilege to work with him. It's astonishing to witness the breadth of his technical knowledge, especially given that he's still quite young. The fact that Hyperwallet now boasts one of the best API developer experiences in the FinTech industry owes a great deal to him. \n\nFlo is a ridiculously fast learner, and efficient almost to a fault. One might be led to think that such qualities would render him unfit to be a leader, when in fact they had the opposite effect -- he was great at planning and distributing tasks. Above all, Flo is meticulous and fair. He also happens to be a really cool guy. \n\nOne of the most talented developers I have ever worked with for sure, and hopefully one day I'll get a chance to work with him again. "
