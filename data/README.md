## Resume

To generate/re-generate the base.json file use the `JSON Resume Exporter`
chrome extension that can be downloaded [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-resume-exporter/caobgmmcpklomkcckaenhjlokpmfbdec/related).

After that go to my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fkrauthan/?locale=en_US) page
and export the profile and save the resulting json as `resume/base.json`.
